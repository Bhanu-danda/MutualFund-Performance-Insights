📊 Mutual Fund Performance & Investment Analytics
🔍 Project Overview

This project is a Power BI–based analytical dashboard designed to analyze mutual fund performance and support data-driven investment decisions.
It transforms raw mutual fund data into interactive insights, enabling users to compare funds, evaluate costs vs returns, and calculate SIP/Lumpsum investments efficiently.

🎯 Purpose of the Project

Analyze historical mutual fund performance

Compare returns across different time horizons

Study the relationship between expense ratio and returns

Provide investment calculators for SIP and Lumpsum planning

Enable faster and more informed decision-making using visualization

👥 Target Users

Retail investors exploring mutual fund options

Students learning financial analytics and Power BI

Beginner and intermediate mutual fund investors

Analysts performing quick fund performance screening

❗ Problem Statements

Identifying top-performing mutual funds from large datasets is challenging

Comparing returns with expense ratios manually is inefficient

Investment return calculations (SIP/Lumpsum) are time-consuming without tools

✅ Objectives

Identify top mutual funds based on long-term returns

Compare fund returns against expense ratio

Analyze mutual funds category-wise (Equity, Debt, Hybrid)

Build dynamic SIP and Lumpsum investment calculators

📁 Data Description

The dataset includes key mutual fund attributes such as:

Fund Name

Fund Category

1-Year, 3-Year, and 5-Year Returns

The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query before analysis.

📐 Key Metrics & Measures

Average 1Y, 3Y, and 5Y Returns

Expense Ratio

Fund Category filtering

Invested Amount
